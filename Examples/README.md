Here you find some examples for different applications of the BluePad32 firmware.

We discern the following types of Lego hubs (look here for an overview of the different firmwares):
- SPIKE3: This is the newest SPIKE Education software running on the yellow SPIKE and SPIKE Essential hubs
- SPIKE Legacy: This is the SPIKE Legacy software which seems still to be supported
 -Inventor: This is the legacy Mindstorms Robot Inventor software which runs on the blue inventor hub and is supported until end of 2024.
- PyBricks: This is the open source alternative firmware that runs on almost any Lego hub

We support two different Bluepad32 firmware:
- BluePad32 LPF2: emulates a LPF2 sensor
- Bluepad32 UartRemote: uses the UART protocol on a hub port

## Pybricks
In order to support BluePad32 on a Pybricks HUB, you need to install the `bluepad.py` library on the Pybricks hub.
